By starting this Extended Essay with a lovely webcomic by Randall Munroe, one can guess that the “4096-BIT RSA” sounds like it is tough to crack. However, what is ”RSA” and how does it work that even a ”MILLION-DOLLAR CLUSTER” is not enough to crack it? The research question of this Extended Essay is - “Does R A provide secure data transmission and confidential certificate signatures?”

This Extended Essay will explore the history of RSA algorithm, the structure of the cryptographic technique, usage of it and ways to crack the algorithm. For the sake of demonstration and proof, I have written several programs in C Language that can help us to understand the process ”behind the curtains”. After all these parts, at the end, we can conclude how RSA technique is secure.
