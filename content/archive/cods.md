Mathematics is the science of skilful operations, which are dealing with the
logic of shape, quantity and rearrangement. Mathematics is using its core
principles and rules to solve problems and get a reasonable answer. In my
opinion, mathematics will soon run out of interesting theories if all new
theories will formulate in terms of invented concept, which appear in
axioms. This exploration is about finding finite values, limits for famous
divergent series and later analytically extending Euler-Riemann's zeta function
to find a limit for any divergent series that can be formed by Euler- Riemann's
zeta function.
