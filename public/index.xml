      <title>Approximation of the limit of Divergent Series</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Divergent series are an invention of the devil and it is shameful to base on them any demonstration whatsoever.&amp;rdquo; - @Abel &amp;ndash; N.H. Abel. 1826
Mathematics is the science of skilful operations, which are dealing with the logic of shape, quantity and rearrangement. Mathematics is using its core principles and rules to solve problems and get a reasonable answer. In my opinion, mathematics will soon run out of interesting theories if all new theories will formulate in terms of invented concept, which appear in axioms.</description>

      <title>Arch Linux Installation</title>

      <description>Pre-Installation Open the Arch Linux Official Website and download the latest .ISO version of the system. Later on just take a flash drive and burn it with rufus on Windows or with any other tool on Linux.
Installation BIOS and Flash Drive BIOS Configuration This part is quite easy. The only thing that you should do is to tell your BIOS to boot from Flash Drives instead of bootloader and other drives.</description>

      <title>RSA: Encrypting, Decrypting, Hacking</title>

      <description>Introduction First time when I heard about RSA technique, was during the ITGS class in IB course. In ITGS Course Companion[@itgs] there is a chapter about Security and Secret Key Encryptions. As an example, the author included two cases of encryption: Symmetric Key Encryption or Single Key Encryption and Asymmetric key encryption, more known as Public Key Encryption.
During the lesson, the fact that a message can be encrypted by one key and only a second key can decrypt the message intrigued me.</description>
