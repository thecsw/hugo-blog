      <description>This competition was the first actual pentest competition in my experience. And oh boy, was in fun. This document will shortly describe the things I did during the competition, mostly to just look at it back sometime later.
Initial scenario We are working for the company called Asnea. More precisely, it is some kind of a military group and we serve around 10 users, who have different positions in the company and have different access levels on all physical machines.</description>

      <description>Pre-Installation Open the Arch Linux Official Website and download the latest .ISO version of the system. Later on just take a flash drive and burn it with rufus on Windows or with any other tool on Linux.
Installation BIOS and Flash Drive BIOS Configuration This part is quite easy. The only thing that you should do is to tell your BIOS to boot from Flash Drives instead of bootloader and other drives.</description>
