      <description>&amp;ldquo;Divergent series are an invention of the devil and it is shameful to base on them any demonstration whatsoever.&amp;rdquo; - @Abel &amp;ndash; N.H. Abel. 1826
Mathematics is the science of skilful operations, which are dealing with the logic of shape, quantity and rearrangement. Mathematics is using its core principles and rules to solve problems and get a reasonable answer. In my opinion, mathematics will soon run out of interesting theories if all new theories will formulate in terms of invented concept, which appear in axioms.</description>

      <description>Introduction First time when I heard about RSA technique, was during the ITGS class in IB course. In ITGS Course Companion[@itgs] there is a chapter about Security and Secret Key Encryptions. As an example, the author included two cases of encryption: Symmetric Key Encryption or Single Key Encryption and Asymmetric key encryption, more known as Public Key Encryption.
During the lesson, the fact that a message can be encrypted by one key and only a second key can decrypt the message intrigued me.</description>
